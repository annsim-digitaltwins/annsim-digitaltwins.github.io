Emerging Topic – Digital Twins (ET-DT)
Guodong (Gordon) Shao and Istvan David

Digital twinning is a transformational trend in many domains, such as smart manufacturing, precision healthcare, and smart energy management. By enabling real-time synchronization with its physical counterpart, a digital twin can provide descriptive (what has happened?), diagnostic (why did it happen?), predictive (what will happen), and prescriptive (how can we make it happen?) functionalities. Many of these functionalities are enabled by simulation. Because of the multidisciplinary nature and complexity of digital twins, their correct and efficient development is especially challenging.

This track aims to provide a forum for researchers and practitioners alike to exchange their latest results and experiences in developing simulators for or by digital twins.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

● Simulation and co-simulation for digital twins, simulation-based digital twins (simulators as the core of digital twins)
● Fidelity, scalability, reliability, trust, security of simulators in digital twins
● Real-time simulation
● Data analytics and data-driven techniques for digital twin development
● Architectural patterns of simulators in digital twinning
● Development lifecycle of digital twins
● Frameworks, methodologies, and formalisms for digital twin development
● Digital twins in support of the Digital Thread
● Digital twins in support of the metaverse
● Verification, Validation and Uncertainty Quantification (VVUQ) of digital twins
● Standards, standardization, and certification of simulators for digital twinning
● Case studies, industry applications, and experience reports
● Human factors in digital twins, such as simulation for or by the human-in-the-loop
● Digital twins for dynamic system (re)configuration and optimization
● Digital twins as a training environment
